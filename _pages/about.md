Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

Hello! I'm Marcela Aguilar, a Ph.D. candidate in Business Accounting at Rice University, with a rich background in economics and public policy from the Universidad Centroamericana José Simeón Cañas (El Salvador) and the University of York (The U.K). My research primarily focuses on the role of accounting in informal economies, drawing from my extensive experience with the International Labour Organization in Central America and the Caribbean.

I'm deeply passionate about applying rigorous research to solve real-world challenges, particularly in developing economies. My work extends beyond academia, involving significant contributions to policy development and implementation in areas like microenterprise development and tackling social issues such as child labor, community violence, and education. With nearly a decade of experience, I have collaborated with chambers of commerce, international organizations, government institutions, and think tanks, enriching my expertise and broadening my impact in these critical areas.

In addition to my professional pursuits, I have a long history in chess, having achieved the title of National Female Chess Champion  in my country. My passion for chess complements my love for travel, allowing me to explore new cultures and perspectives.

Thank you for visiting my site! I am happy to collaborate with those committed to conducting impactful research in the real world.
